# TokenManagement Smart Contract

TokenManagement is a basic token management system implemented as a Solidity smart contract. It provides functionality for minting, transferring, and burning tokens.

## Description

The TokenManagement contract demonstrates fundamental concepts of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows the creation of tokens, transferring tokens between addresses, and burning tokens.

## Getting Started

To interact with the TokenManagement contract, follow these steps:

1. Use Remix IDE: Visit [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and create a new Solidity file (e.g., `TokenManagement.sol`).
2. Copy and paste the contract code from the `TokenManagement.sol` file in this repository.
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity Compiler in Remix (choose a compatible compiler version).
4. Deploy the contract using the Deploy & Run Transactions tab in Remix.
5. Interact with the contract's functions using Remix's UI.

## Contract Functions

### `mintTokens(address _receiver, uint256 _amount)`

Mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address. Only the contract owner can call this function.

### `transferTokens(address _to, uint256 _amount)`

Transfer tokens from the sender's balance to a specified address.

### `burnTokens(uint256 _amount)`

Burn a specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance.

### `getTokenBalance(address _account)`

Retrieve the token balance of a specified account.

## Example Usage

1. Deploy the contract on a local or test Ethereum network.
2. Mint tokens to a designated address using the `mintTokens` function.
3. Transfer tokens to another address using the `transferTokens` function.
4. Burn tokens using the `burnTokens` function.
5. Check token balances using the `getTokenBalance` function.
